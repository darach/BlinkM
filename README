BlinkM by ThinkM
================

The BlinkM is a family of breakout boards providing convenient scriptability to
and interaction with a network of RGB LEDs. This is a quick port of the BlinkM
core library to support the Arduino 1.0 API which has normalized API calls across
SDKs.

Nota Bene - This variant may diverge from the core library by ThingM over time.

Enjoy!
